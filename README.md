# Data Structures and Sorting Algorithms in Java

This repository is my collection and implementation of classic data structures and sorting algorithms in Java. It serves as a resource for (self?) educational purposes, showcasing fundamental concepts in computer science.

## Data Structures Included

- **LinkedList**: Implementation of a singly linked list.
- **Stack**: Custom dynamic stack implementation.

## Sorting Algorithms

The `sorting` package includes the following algorithms:

- **BubbleSort**
- **InsertionSort**
- **MergeSort**
- **QuickSort**
- **SelectionSort**

Each sorting algorithm is implemented in its own class and can be tested individually.

## Search Algorithms

In addition to sorting algorithms, this repository also contains implementations of search algorithms:

- **Linear Search**: A simple algorithm that checks every element until the target is found.
- **Binary Search**: A more efficient algorithm that repeatedly divides the search interval in half until the target is found.

Both algorithms are implemented in the `LinearBinarySearch` class.
